# BERT for protein sequences
Predicting the disease risk of protein mutation sequences with BERT pre-training model

Here are the data and code we used for the project of predicting protein mutation sequences.

(1) The 'Pretrain-model' directory contains the codes of BERT we pretrained for BRCA1 gene;

(2) The 'Predict' directory contains data and codes for predicting mutation sequences;

If you have any questions about the code, please contact us.
Thanks~ :)
